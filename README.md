## How to create a GitHub Page:

[1] Create repository with your username as the repository name. (Any repo name will work too)

[2] Clone repository in your local machine. 
	
	git clone username.github.io

[3] Push webpage resources (Note the index.html file)
	
	git add -A
	git commit -m "commit message"
	git push -u origin main


[4] If using a repo-name that is not username.github.io, visit Settings>Pages>Branch and select main. 

[5] Visit deployed page in username.github.io or username.github.io/repo-name



## Key Takeaways in this Exercise:
[1] I was able to recall my previous knowledge in HTML and CSS which I last encountered in CMSC 12. 

[2] I was also able to make use of the Flexbox CSS layout module. It is a very helpful tool when positioning webpage elements and is set to make the process easier. 

[3] I was also able to learn how to deploy a webpage using Github Pages.
