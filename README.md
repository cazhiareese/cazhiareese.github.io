How to create a GitHub Page:
	Create repository with your username as the repository name. (Any repo name will work too)

	Clone repository in your local machine. 


	Push webpage resources (Note the index.html file)


	If using a repo-name that is not username.github.io, visit Settings>Pages>Branch and select main. 

	Visit deployed page in username.github.io or username.github.io/repo-name



Key Takeaways in this Exercise:
	I was able to recall my previous knowledge in HTML and CSS which I last encountered in CMSC 12. 

	I was also able to make use of the Flexbox CSS layout module. It is a very helpful tool when positioning webpage elements and is set to make the process easier. 

	I was also able to learn how to deploy a webpage using Github Pages.
